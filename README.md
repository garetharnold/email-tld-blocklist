# Email TLD Blocklist

This repository contains a JSON file with a list of Top-Level Domains (TLDs) that are commonly associated with spam, fraudulent activities, or specific organizational types (e.g., military and educational institutions) which should be avoided in email communications. This list is intended to help improve the quality and security of email communications by filtering out undesirable domains.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date blocklist of TLDs that are:

- Frequently associated with spam and low-quality emails.
- Used in phishing and other fraudulent activities.
- Associated with military organizations for security reasons.
- Associated with educational institutions to prevent unsolicited emails.

## Usage

This blocklist can be used by email service providers, marketers, and individuals who want to enhance their email filtering systems. 

By incorporating this list into your email filtering mechanism, you can reduce the likelihood of encountering spam, phishing attempts, and unsolicited emails.

## Future

- I will continuall add to this list 
- I will also compile indiviual lists for academic / gov / spam / countries / science etc eventually.
